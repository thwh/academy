<h2><span id="plus">+</span> Meditation for Skeptics</h2>

<p>
What is meditation?
</p>

<p>
It is smoothing out of conscious attention.
</p>

<p>
It begins by stilling the body. Most practitioners sit, but any posture is possible. Sensory response should be monitored, averaged, and gently restrained. With this achieved the conscious focal point can be moved to various places within the sphere of attention, but while refraining from overexertion. This means the nervous system collects data, and we avoid acting on any tension, itch, or impulse. The stillness of the body begins to affect the mind. The mind however, has its own set of internalized organs -- it "hears," it "sees", it "feels". The mind is a world of virtual cause and effect, but where the ability to create stimuli as part of a response makes *feedback* possible, and hence whole other orders of causal complexity and wavelike behavior. All this is fascinating and the mind is definitely still *not* understood. Yet despite the fact that the talkativeness of the mind is the primary obstacle in the practice of meditation, a complete understanding of the mind is not only unnecessary, the wish for it is itself a symptom of the typical disease. Comprehension is not necessary to master and calm the mind such that good meditation can take place. The mind is an organ, like others. There is also the stomach, the heart, the lungs, and more.
</p>

<p>
Focus on the breath is most effective means of ending the stalemate of incessant thinking. The mind cannot be made to shutup, it can only be soothed, witnessed, accepted. And eventually given enough care, it will quiet down. An authoritative approach generally fails, as with children, if there lacks a sufficient atmosphere of profound care. The ego must *want* to be quiet.
</p>

<p>
But deep meditation is not about control or willpower. Good meditation is about <i>alignment</i>. The body and the nervous system in particular can be compared to an instrument. There is sufficient internal tension to produce a sensitivity to external impulse, which is filtered according to its own shape and symmetry to produce a coherent response. Then what is meditation? It is tuning of this instrument, and sometimes afterward a bit of careful noodling. This noodling upon a delicate instrument is Qi Gong.
</p>

<h2><span id="plus">+</span> Qi Gong</h2>

<p>What is Qi Gong?</p>

<p>
Qi Gong (氣功) means "breath work".
It exploits the uncanny perceptual phenomena that can arise in meditation to
produce novel configurations of sensation and feedback. The exercises emphasize both strict alignment and maximum relaxation. This leaves as much muscular strength left over as possible, allowing long, controlled and fluid movements.
</p>

<p>
The core of the body, where the majority of the strength resides, is made to do as much work as possible. The spine is given maximum length. The pelvis is low, relaxed, open. The legs are wide, the arms hang. The head is upright and alert.
</p>

<p>
In this stance Qi Gong begins, and meditation takes on a new playful tone, which alleviates the pressure of the task of pure concentration. The unfortunate truth is that meditation as practiced by the "serious" students in Zen, and to a lesser extent in the Tibetan tradition, tends to lose the sense of fun in the art. Their practice becomes dreary. All meditation discipline involves long periods of drought, but in our opinion there is too much shame present in most dharma and this leaves students feeling they have no right to "play" with their practice freely.
</p>

<p>
Meditation and its gifts are our birthright. We seek to
teach this art in its most shameless, innocent, and scientific form.
