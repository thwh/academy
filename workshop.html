<h2>Meditation Workshops</h2>

<p>
Many of us have become curious about meditation as the evidence of its benefits
pile up. As a <a href="about.html">scientifically-minded engineer</a>, I believe the time has come to liberate the
<a href="meditation.html">art of meditation</a> from its religious cocoon.
</p>

<p>
Our classes are a no-nonsense introduction to meditation. We specialize in training a few select groups that benefit from a minimalistic approach:

<!-- We teach those who either find the usual channels too religiously distasteful, or are usually left out of cultural revolutions: -->

</p>

<ul>
<li>Scientists, engineers, and other skeptics</li>
<li>Autistic children</li>
<li>Prison populations</li>
<li>The physically disabled</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a non-profit, <strong>our goal is to offer this service at very low cost to qualifying groups</strong>. We will make it work if we believe there is the need.
</p>

<p>
We offer weekend and daylong workshops onsite. We work primarily in the Bay Area, Reno, and New York City, but almost anywhere in the world is possible. Contact us to discuss.
