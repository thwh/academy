<h2><span id="plus">+</span> Psychoanalysis</h2>

<p>
What is psychoanalysis? It is talk therapy in its purest state. It is the art of wielding language to change unconscious thinking, which is itself a form of language.
</p>

<p>
Speech can have the mysterious power to heal. How do we liberate ourselves from
the stupidity of words? Only with the magic of words. By developing a neutrality
towards our own speech, we learn to accept new, anxious, seemingly impossible
thoughts. Behind those impossibilities lies our psychological freedom. Freedom
from self-sabotage, from repression, and from the constriction that trauma leaves behind.
</p>

<p>
"Just say the next thing" as my analyst used to say. There is no one state of
being we're searching for. Anxiety, depression, and rage are sometimes healthy.
A better sense of humor, a lack of shame, and a general courageousness are the
fruits of the path. The "healed" people I know aren't certain and smug -- but
grounded, cheerful, and awake.
